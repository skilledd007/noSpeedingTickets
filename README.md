App that plays an unpleasant sound when the vehicle is above the posted speed limit. In addition, it tracks speeding events and allows you to view when and where you were speeding, and at what speed you were going. Ideally, this should be able to provide a maps view with an overlay of the most common places that a person speeds, in order to build better awarness of bad habits. Eventually, it would be awesome if speeding data, in addition to other data points could be used to build a database of drivers and their habits. This would be useful for the insurance industry to adjust premius dynamically as well as ensure that drivers who are otherwise safe are not penalized for factors out of their control, (i.e. teenagers).
